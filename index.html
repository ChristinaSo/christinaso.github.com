        <h3>W3Lc0m3, cyber visitor...</h3>

  <p>W3Lc0m3, cyber visitor. I am an intern at Youth Radio, a non-profit organization in Oakland. In the Mobile Action Lab, a group I am part of, we are currently learning programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and so on. You learn so much at Youth Radio!</p>

  <p>So far, in the Mobile Action Lab, we have created two applications that can be accessed using a computer or smart phone. One of the apps, Forage City, has already been soft launched at Code for America, a hackathon.</p>

  <p>The second app, which I will not disclose until it has been launched, is coming along extremely well.</p>

  <p>Although the lab team has created two apps, neither of the two apps were programmed by the youth in the team. Lacking a teacher to teach us, we sought the help of programmers outside of Youth Radio to help us create those two apps.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this year (2012) we were able to learn how to code with the help of our newly hired teacher, Kurt. Our journey to the programming world has begun!</p>

  <p>"There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always complain about and those nobody uses.‚Äù

<h3>School Life</h3>

  <p>School life has been <em><strong>really</strong></em> stressful.</p>

  <p>The difference between school and life? In school, you're taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you're given a test that teaches you a lesson. ~Tom Bodett</p>

<h3>Randomness</h3>
  <h4>So much of life, it seems to me, is determined by pure randomness. ~Sidney Poitier </h2>
