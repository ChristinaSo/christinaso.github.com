<p>W3Lc0m3, cyber visitor. (#undernocircumstances shud sum1 feel its ok 2 tlk lik this. You have 140 characters. Use them and stop typing like you're illiterate.  ~@Lord_Voldemort7) 
I am an intern at Youth Radio, a non-profit organization in Oakland. In the Mobile Action Lab, a group I am part of, we are currently learning programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and so on. You learn so much at Youth Radio!</p>

<p>So far, in the Mobile Action Lab, we have created two applications that can be accessed using a computer or smart phone. One of the apps, Forage City, has already been soft launched at Code for America, a hackathon.</p>

<p>The second app, which I will not disclose until it is launched, is coming along extremely well.</p>

<p>Although the lab team has created two apps, neither of the two apps were programmed by the youth in the team. Lacking a teacher to teach us, we sought the help of programmers outside of Youth Radio.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this year 2012 we were able to learn how to code with the help of our new teacher, Kurt. Our journey to the programming world has begun!</p>

<p>"There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always complain about and those nobody uses.‚Äù

<h3>School Life</h3>

<p>School life has been <em><strong>really</strong></em> stressful.</p>
